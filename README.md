# LangFlow-docker

Simple Docker wrapper for [LangFlow](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow).

This is basically just a copy-paste of the [docker example in their repo](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow/tree/dev/docker_example), so that you don't need to clone the whole repo.

There is also a [hosted version on the UI](https://logspace-langflow.hf.space/)

## Running

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

The web UI will be accessible on some port (still figuring out which)
