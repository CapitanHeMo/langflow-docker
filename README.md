# LangFlow-docker

Simple Docker wrapper for [LangFlow](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow).

This is basically just a copy-paste of the [docker example](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow/tree/dev/docker_example) in their repo, so that you don't need to clone the whole repo.

## Running

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

The web UI will be accessible on some port (still figuring out which)
